Heavily insprired by [this minimalistic launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devswhocare.productivitylauncher), I wanted icons
and a space to add notes as reminders on my home screen. Also wanted to practice and brush up on Kotlin.<br>

Features of the Launcher
- Notes/Reminders on your home page
- Battery percentage indicator and Clock view
- App Drawer showing icons and app name
- Save apps to home screen to quickly access important apps
